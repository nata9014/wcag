   <p class="note">Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).</p>

   <p class="note">When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be
      used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border
      around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that
      fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.

   <p class="note">WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that
      an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not
      consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except
      where caused by authors' code.

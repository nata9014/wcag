   <p><a>audio</a> or <a>video</a> synchronized with another format for presenting information and/or with time-based
      interactive components, unless the media is a <a>media alternative for text</a> that is clearly labeled as such
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">"Synchronized" refers to the fact the audio and video are intended to be played according to the same time base. It is not intended to imply that images and videos that are out of synch with each other (intentionally or unintentionally) in the same experience are excluded by the definition. Asynchronous sound, for example, is still being experienced in the context of time-based, synchronized media.</p>
